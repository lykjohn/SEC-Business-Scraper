<p > 
  This is an information tool to retrieve official business financials (income statements, balance sheets, and cashflow statements) for a sepcified range of times. 
The code aims to be as vallina as possible by minimizing the depndencies and packages ued for function constructions. 
This code can be used immediately off the shelf and assumes no more than the packages stated in the README.md fileto be installed. 
As a reminder, please ensure that your directory has enough space, ideally at least 100 MB for newly　serialized reports to reside on the disk until you decide to clear them.
